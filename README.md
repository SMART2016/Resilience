# resilienceautomation

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage


### create jar of the clojure project to be used with java

1. Open terminal
2. Make sure that lein or clojure is installed in the environment, if not follow below steps to install:
		
		https://leiningen.org/ 

3. Go to the clojure project directory for example "resilienceautomation"
4. Run the below command to create jar for the clojure project:

		>>lein uberjar

5. The above step will create a folder "target" inside the project folder which will contain 2 jars.
6. The jar that will be inter operable with your java and you will have to use that clojure jar in your java project will be ending with 

	<projectname>-<version>-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
	Eg: resilienceautomation-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

7. Add the jar into the classpath of your java application and access it as any other java class.

   <b>Note:</b> Right now the current clojure exposes all methods as static methods for simplicity.

## How do I access the Docker REST API remotely?


1. Edit the file /lib/systemd/system/docker.service

		sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
2. Modify the line that starts with ExecStart to look like this:

		ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:1111
		Save the modified file. Here I used port 1111, but any free port can be used.

3. Make sure the Docker service notices the modified configuration:

		systemctl daemon-reload
4. Restart the Docker service:
		
		sudo service docker restart
5. Test

		curl http://localhost:1111/version

6. See the result

		{"Version":"17.05.0-ce","ApiVersion":"1.29","MinAPIVersion":"1.12","GitCommit":"89658be","GoVersion":"go1.7.5","Os":"linux","Arch":"amd64","KernelVersion":"4.15.0-20-generic","BuildTime":"2017-05-04T22:10:54.638119411+00:00"}
		Now you can use the REST API.
